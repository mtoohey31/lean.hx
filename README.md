# lean.hx

A Lean 4 plugin for Helix.

## TODO

- [x] Unicode input
- [x] Info view (requires [fork](https://github.com/mtoohey31/helix/tree/lean.hx); only the basics work)
- [x] File-specific server restart (via [fork](https://github.com/mtoohey31/helix/tree/lean.hx))
- [x] Progress gutter (via [fork](https://github.com/mtoohey31/helix/tree/lean.hx))
- [ ] Figure out something better for syntax highlighting. Semantic tokens would be ideal but Helix maintainers don't seem interested in supporting this.
