# lean.hx

A Lean 4 plugin for Helix. Currently just getting started.

## TODO

- [x] Unicode input
  - [ ] Eager replacement
- [ ] Info view
- [ ] File-specific server restart
- [ ] Progress gutter
- [ ] Figure out something better for syntax highlighting. Semantic tokens would be ideal but Helix maintainers don't seem interested in supporting this.
